# GoldBadgeChallenges
Business Challenges
We built three different console apps based on three different business scenarios/ challenges. Each includes a testing class, repo, and a program UI.
One of my favorite parts about this assignment was being able to set up the user interface, it was really cool to think about how the user would want to interact
with each console and coming up with fun creative ways to put a little flavor of our own into the challenges.
Some challenges that were faced along the way:
One challenging thing for me was deciding which methods i needed to use in my testing class and which methods would be used in only my UI. I can 
see how it would be very confusing in a large application if you kept everything inside of your repository.  If I did not run out of time I would have
liked to gone back and cleaned up my repositories a little bit more.  Another challenging thing for me was the Program UI in the Badges challenge,for some
reason i really struggled with this but did not struggle too much on the other two. After going through office hours on Wednesday I also noticed that i was making 
the testing methods a lot harder then they needed to be.  I tried setting up my methods in badges as booleans so that they would be far easier to test then the other two
tests that i ran for the menu and claims.  I also struggled with understanding the update part of the repository and how you would be able to test that.  
Another struggle that I had was I noticed that when I used Date time for my class in the claims for the date of incident and date of claim filed I noticed that 
my date that i entered through my seed queue would show up as nothing. It would just show up as all zeros. I did not notice it until the very end and could not figure out a way
to fix it before it had to be turned in. 
I feel that I have made a ginormous leap in these business challenges compared to where i was during the hangman game.
